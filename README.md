## Model Providers

This project uses a custom fine-tuned OpenAI model (`rohan/tune-gpt-4o`) as the default. The model is tailored to provide healthcare-specific responses for both doctors and patients.

## Deploy Your Own

You can deploy your own version of TeddyCare to Vercel with one click:

[![Deploy with Vercel](https://vercel.com/button)](https://vercel.com/new/clone?repository-url=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FTeddyCare%2Fteddycare&project-name=teddycare&repository-name=teddycare&demo-title=TeddyCare&demo-description=AI-powered%20healthcare%20assistant&demo-url=https%3A%2F%2Fteddycare.vercel.app&demo-image=https%3A%2F%2Fteddycare.vercel.app%2Fopengraph-image.png)

## Creating a KV Database Instance

Follow the steps outlined in the [quick start guide](https://vercel.com/docs/storage/vercel-kv/quickstart#create-a-kv-database) provided by Vercel. This guide will assist you in creating and configuring your KV database instance on Vercel, enabling your application to interact with it.

Remember to update your environment variables (`KV_URL`, `KV_REST_API_URL`, `KV_REST_API_TOKEN`, `KV_REST_API_READ_ONLY_TOKEN`) in the `.env` file with the appropriate credentials provided during the KV database setup.

## Running locally

You will need to use the environment variables [defined in `.env.example`](.env.example) to run TeddyCare. It's recommended you use [Vercel Environment Variables](https://vercel.com/docs/projects/environment-variables) for this, but a `.env` file is all that is necessary.

> Note: You should not commit your `.env` file or it will expose secrets that will allow others to control access to your various OpenAI and authentication provider accounts.

1. Install Vercel CLI: `npm i -g vercel`
2. Link local instance with Vercel and GitHub accounts (creates `.vercel` directory): `vercel link`
3. Download your environment variables: `vercel env pull`
